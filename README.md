# SPP_job_prediction
Here we will be giving job description so that we can find which job is accurate and which are all fake jobs so that the user can easily identify and can apply to the actual jobs and truthful jobs that are being posted  we use basic EDA For this job description project

Here we haven't used any predefined ML models rather we have created our own model similar to custom weighted model. This will be creating a knowledge about how ML works at the backend, So that you can create your own model with other ideas. this article act as a bridge between that. First, we will visualize the insights from the fake and real jobs postings and then will use custom weight based on there word count by total word count and predict the real and fake job postings. Finally , we will evaluate the performance of our classifier using several evaluation matrix

Based on these customization we can even improve these efficiency even more better this job prediction is purely based on modelling and training a data which doesn’t involve any other predefined models so once need to know like how modelling is done at the back end so can refer this model and make their own models, only logic differs but the procedure is same even this is very helpful for starting a model on your own then using any other custom driven models.

Future Enhancements
Training only the columns which are entirely correlated with each other and drop all the columns which are non correlated with each other.
Giving the weight of each words can be specified based on some research such that for fraud data 20% higher than Non fraud data.
Even we can do more EDA on the given data to find the exact correlation words from the col and weight them more than non correlated words. ex: location- country, capital and cap-pincode etc.
